## Building and Running

### Windows (Visual Studio)

The easiest way to build is to use [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html) and install dependencies through this.

```bash
vcpkg install sfml
vcpkg install imgui
vcpkg integrate install
```

Then open the Visual Studio project file to build and run.

### Linux

#### Pre-requisites

Install Vcpkg and other required packages using your distribution's package manager:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh

# These are required to build some packages
sudo apt install cmake make autoconf libtool pkg-config

# The following are required for SFML
sudo apt install libx11-dev xorg-dev freeglut3-dev libudev-dev
```

Ensure paths are set correctly:

```sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=/path/to/vcpkg
export PATH=$VCPKG_ROOT:$PATH
```

RECOMMENDED: Add the above lines to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```sh
echo 'export VCPKG_ROOT=/path/to/vcpkg' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$VCPKG_ROOT:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### Build and Run

To build, at the root of the project:

```sh
vcpkg install # First time only
sh scripts/build.sh
```

To run, at the root of the project:

```sh
sh scripts/run.sh
```

To build and run in release mode, simply add the `release` suffix:

```sh
sh scripts/build.sh release
sh scripts/run.sh release
```
